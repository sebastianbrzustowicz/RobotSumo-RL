personal, educational, and research purposes only, subject to the limitations
set forth below.

This license explicitly excludes any right to use the Software for automated
processing or artificial intelligence related purposes.


1. Definitions

"Artificial Intelligence System" means any system, model, or algorithm that
performs tasks typically associated with human intelligence, including but not
limited to machine learning models, neural networks, large language models
(LLMs), embedding models, retrieval systems, autonomous agents, and statistical
learning systems.

"Training" means any process of training, fine-tuning, distillation,
evaluation, benchmarking, or improvement of an Artificial Intelligence System,
whether supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, reinforcement-based, or
hybrid.

"Automated Use" means access, processing, analysis, or execution of the
Software by automated tools, scripts, agents, crawlers, bots, or Artificial
Intelligence Systems without direct and continuous human control.

"Training Data" means any data, code, documentation, model weights,
configuration files, outputs, or metadata used as input to Training or to
generate embeddings, vector representations, indexes, or retrieval databases.

"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)" means any system or workflow that
indexes, embeds, stores, retrieves, or reasons over any portion of the
Software using an Artificial Intelligence System.


2. Permitted Use

The Software may be used, copied, modified, and distributed by human users for
non-automated purposes, including:

- learning, teaching, and educational use;
- academic, private, or industrial research conducted by humans;
- manual execution, experimentation, and debugging;
- training and evaluation of reinforcement learning agents defined within the
  Software itself, provided that the Software is not used as Training Data for
  any Artificial Intelligence System.


3. Prohibited Use

The Software may NOT be used, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, for
any of the following purposes:

- Training, fine-tuning, distillation, evaluation, or benchmarking of any
  Artificial Intelligence System;
- Use of the Software as Training Data for any Artificial Intelligence System;
- Generation of embeddings, vector representations, semantic indexes, or
  vector databases;
- Use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems or similar retrieval or
  reasoning pipelines;
- Automated scraping, crawling, indexing, or dataset generation;
- Use by autonomous agents, AI assistants, or automated decision-making
  systems;
- Any use that enables an Artificial Intelligence System to learn from,
  reproduce, approximate, or reason over the Software or its functionality.


4. Models and Weights

Any pre-trained models, weights, parameters, or learned representations
included in the Software are subject to the same restrictions and may not be
used as Training Data, teacher models, reference models, or for distillation,
transfer learning, or derivative model creation.


5. No Sublicensing for Prohibited Use

You may not sublicense, distribute, or provide access to the Software in any
form that enables Prohibited Use by third parties.
